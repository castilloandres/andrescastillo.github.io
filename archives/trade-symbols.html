<p>• Market: is a buy or sell order to be executed immediately at the current market prices</p>
<p>• LIMIT: A buy limit order can only be executed at the limit price or lower. A sell limit order is analogous; it can only be executed at the limit price or higher.</p>
<p>• STOP: is an instruction to sell at the best available price after the price goes below the stop price.</p>
<p>• STOP LIMIT: is an order to buy or sell a stock that combines the features of a stop order and a limit order.</p>
<p>• PAY:</p>
<p>• GTC: (Good-til-cancelled) orders require a specific cancelling order, which can persist indefinitely (although brokers may set some limits, for example, 90 days).</p>
<p>• FOK: (Fill or kill) orders are usually limit orders that must be executed or cancelled immediately. Unlike IOC orders, FOK orders require the full quantity to be executed.</p>
<p>• IOC: (Immediate or cancel) orders are immediately executed or cancelled by the exchange. Unlike FOK orders, IOC orders allow for partial fills.</p>
