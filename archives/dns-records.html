    <li>NS records: An NS record will specify the servers which are providing DNS services for that domain name.</li>
    <li>A record: An A record (Address Record) translates the human-readable domain name “example.com” to an IP address..</li>
    <li>CNAME record:A CNAME (Canonical Name) points one domain or subdomain to another domain name</li>
    <li>AAAA record: The AAAA record is similar to the A record, but it allows you to point the domain to an Ipv6 address.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>DNS Resolution Process for CNAME Records</h2>
  <p>
    1. A DNS client (such as a browser or network device) requests the address www.example.com, and a DNS request is created.
    2. A DNS resolver receives the request and finds the Authoritative Name Server that holds the DNS Zone file with DNS records for the “example.com” domain.
    3. The DNS request is resolved and the CNAME record is returned to the client.
    4. The client understands www.example.com is only an alias for the real address, “example.com”, and issues a new DNS query for “example.com”
    5. The process is repeated and the resolver returns the A record for “example.com”, containing the IP address.
    6. The DNS client now connects to “example.com” using its IP address.
