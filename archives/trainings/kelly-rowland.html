  <h3>1 round of "Kelly"</h3>
  <p>400m run.</p>
  <p>30 box jumps.</p>
  <p>30 wall balls.</p>

  <h3>Comments and strategy:</h3>
  <p>Pace yourself on the first buy-in of the 50 calories bike, pause yourself on the box jumps on the box not on the floor and break the walls balls in two sets of 15. Remember to keep a pace since you need energy for the last 50 calories bike.</p> 
  <h3>Feeling before the WOD:</h3>
  <p>Feeling Okay.</p>
  <h3>Feeling during the WOD:</h3>
  <p>I ate too much before. Felt I was going to throw up.</p>
  <h3>Feeling after the WOD:</h3>
