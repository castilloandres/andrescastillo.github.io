  <h1>Mr. Flin - WOD</h1>
  <h3>5 rounds - 4min per round.</h3>
  <p>3 chest to bars.</p>
  <p>3 toes to bars.</p>
  <p>9 deadlifts 102kg/82Kg.</p>
  <h3>15/12 calories bike.</h3>

  <h3>Comments and strategy:</h3>
  <p>It's a sprint. Nevertheless keep in mind that that rounds 4 and 5 are the ones that are going to hurt since your arms and legs are going to be tired from the pulled weight from previous rounds (t2b, c2b and deadlifts).</p> 
  <h3>Feeling before the WOD: cloudy in the head. Lost? Had a rough day at work.</h3>
  <p>Feeling Okay.</p>
  <h3>Feeling during the WOD:</h3>
  <p>Felt better each round.</p>
  <h3>Feeling after the WOD:</h3>
  <p>Felt great. Progressively augmented speed and power each round.</p>
  <h3>Time / Performance:</h3>
  <p>Managed to get each round in under 2 minutes.</p>
