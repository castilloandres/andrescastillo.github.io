                <p>The power of predictive analytics is becoming increasingly accessible to businesses and these predictions have the potential to optimize the sales funnel, improve conversion rates, lead veolocity and amplify revenue.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>How can I know what is driving the web traffic behaviour that consumers are engaging in?</li>
                  <li>Why do some pages capture more attention while others have higher bounce rate?</li>
                  <li>How can I know which consumers to target with Facebook or display Ads?</li>
                  <li>How can I qualify and prioritize the leads generated by my digital marketing efforts?</li>
                  <li>How can I estimate what the value of one customer will be compared to another, so I know which one will be worth the cost of acquisition?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The answers of these questions depend on predictive modeling and predictive analytics by doing the following:, modeling consumer behaviour, qualifying and prioritizing leads, targeting and segmenting customers an</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Modeling consumer behaviour.</li>
                  <li>Qualifying and prioritizing leads.</li>
                  <li>Targeting and segmenting customers.</li>
                  <li>Estimating customer lifetime value (CLV).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the realm of sophisticated marketing, historical data can only take a business so far. Equipped with insights into customer patterns and campaign performance, the next step is to translate this data into efficient action combining marketing with predictive technologies allows marketing professionals to craft a richer picture of their audience and predict their future behaviour.</p>

                <p>Predictive analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that is used to formulate predictions and unknown future events with tools like:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Data mining.</li>
                  <li>Statistical Analysis.</li>
                  <li>Automated machine learning algorithms.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Most distinctively in the fields of big data and machine learning and data science can assist marketers in:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Who will be my next customer?</li>
                  <li>How do I convert them?</li>
                  <li>How can I source more of these ideal customers?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These insights enable:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Stronger predictions.</li>
                  <li>Decide which campaigns to run.</li>
                  <li>Provide more promising leads.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Predictive Marketing</h3>
                <p>Esentially predictive marketing is predictive analytics utilized by marketing.</p>
                <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
                  <a href="../../../../images/blog/predictive-analytics/why-it-happened.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="../../../images/blog/predictive-analytics/why-it-happened.jpg" alt="statistical analysis" title="statistical analysis"></a>
                </div>

                <h3>How does predictive marketing work?</h3>
                <p>By collecting data from various sources such as Google Analytics, Facebook Insights and other gathering tools consolidating it with marketing and customer data to build a predictive model suited to the business.</p>
                <p>Analysis is interestingly placed higher value than prediction because if a marketer is able to understand why something is happening they can have a reasonable understanding of what will happen. Analysis or knowing why typically requires <strong>casual inference</strong> - knowing what causes the outcomes being measured. It is important to know why a consumer is buying a product but it is very hard at the same time.</p>
                <p>Amazon does it's predictive analytics with Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) which is a tool for big data processing and analysis.</p>

                <h3>How Amazon leverages big data for predictive analytics:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Customer recommendations.</li>
                  <li>Sale items based on what you bought and searched in the past.</li>
                  <li>Personalized and focused buying experience.</li>
                  <li>Big data works, don't get overwhelmed make it work for you.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>Predictive marketing organization: predictive analytics + marketing sales to generate biggest ROI.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Predictive analytics helps us understand:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>How consumer behaviour will evolve.</li>
                  <li>Which consumers to target.</li>
                  <li>Which consumers are willing to pay or respond to discounts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Prediction for display ads:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Who is most likely to convert.</li>
                  <li>Who is most likely to deliver greatest value.</li>
                  <li>How much should I bid.</li>
                  <li>More value > Bid</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Predictive modeling for ad targeting:</h3>
                <p>Prediction: Behavioural data + customer data + sales data</p>
                <p>P(Cijt) = F(Dit + Bit + Sit + Lit)</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Dit: Demographic features.</li>
                  <li>Bit: Behavioural features.</li>
                  <li>Sit: Social features.</li>
                  <li>Lit: Location features.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Evaluating a model</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Precision: the fraction of predictions that are relevant.</li>
                  <li>Recall: the fraction of relevant instances that are identified.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="4u 12u$(medium)">

                </div>

                <h3>Predictive analytics for network targeting (friends and friends of friends)</h3>
                <p>P(Cijt) = F(Dit + Bit + Sit + Lit + Σj Wij Yjt)</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Dit: Demographic features.</li>
                  <li>Bit: Behavioural features.</li>
                  <li>Sit: Social features.</li>
                  <li>Lit: Location features.</li>
                  <li>Wij: weight between consumer "i" and "j", who the friends of consumer "i" are and how strong the relationship is.</li>
                  <li>Yjt: adoption status of friend "j" at time "t". If they adopted the product or not at time "t".</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Who are we targeting and what values are we using? by just adding a single variable in network targeting towards network neighbours that have a probability of picking up the product has 5x improvement in sales.</p>
                <p>The power of social networks and ad network targeting in finding a key variable in predictive modeling.</p>
                <h3>Skeptics: addressing predictive modeling and missconceptions.</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>You don't need a Phd to build a predictive model.</li>
                  <li>A predictive model should not be a black box.</li>
                  <li>Even if you know your modeling data can help, modeling either "turns or confirms" assumptions.</li>
                  <li>Predictive models can be implemented quickly.</li>
                  <li>Predictive models enhance human judgement, not replace it.</li>
                  <li>Consumer behaviour is also important, scientific evidence is not always proof.</li>
                  <li>Big data can help but processing data is far more important.</li>
                  <li>Predictive analytics produces insights. Turning those insights into action takes both intuition and managerial skills.</li>
                  <li>Predictive analytics are not only for big companies.</li>
                  <li>Database skills + statistical knowledge + understanding the business are key for predictive analytics.</li>
                  <li>A models accuracy has no correlation to business value. A model can be highly accurate but offer little value to the business. For example a model that accurately predicts customer birth days holds little or no value for companies that sell to other businesses but can be very profitable to an internet company that sells online gift card to consumers.</li>
                  <li>Correlation is different than causation. Ice cream that kills.</li>
                  <li>More data usually makes predictions better but some events can radically change the model.</li>
                  <li>Predictive analytics can help connect between events and behaviour.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Q&A</h3>
                <ul>

                <h3>Predictive modeling in practice:</h3>
                <p>Things to know before building data science in your company:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Data scientists:</strong> machine learning, data mining, statistical models.</li>
                  <li><strong>Data analysts:</strong>less technical but much broader training proximity and accountability to the business unit.</li>
                  <li><strong>Data infrastructure:</strong> build and manage databases.</li>
                </ul>
